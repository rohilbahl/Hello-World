                Photosynthesis in the leaves of plants involves many steps, but it can be divided into two stages: the Light  reactions and the Dark Reactions.<br/>
                The light-dependent reactions take place in the thylakoid membrane and require a continuous supply of light energy. Chlorophylls absorb this light <br/>
                energy, which is converted into chemical energy through the formation of two compounds, ATP, an energy storage molecule and NADPH reduced (electron bearing) <br/>
                electron carrier. In this process, water molecules are also converted to oxygen gas, the oxygen we breathe!<br/>

            <h2>Dark Reactions</h2>
            <p class="p2">

                The Dark Reactions(Calvin cycle), also called the light-independent reactions, takes place in the stroma and does not directly require light. Instead, the Calvin <br/>
                cycle uses ATP and NADPH from the light dependent reactions to fix carbon dioxide and produce three carbon sugars,  glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate, or G3P, molecules  <br/>
                which join up to form glucose.<br/>
