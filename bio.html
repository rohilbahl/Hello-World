            <p>
                Photosynthesis is a process without which none of us would be alive. It is one of the most important biological process. <br/>
                Photosynthesis is the process by which plants/bacteria/algae combine sunlight, water and carbon dioxide to give oxygen and carbohydrates.

            <h3>Oxygenic and Anoxygenic</h3>
            <p>
                During oxygenic photosynthesis, light energy transfers electrons from water (H2O) to carbon dioxide (CO2), which produces carbohydrates. Oxygen is also produced. <br/>
               Anoxygenic photosynthesis is the phototrophic process where light energy is captured and converted to ATP, without the production of oxygen; water is, therefore, not used as an electron donor.
