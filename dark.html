        <h1>THE IMPORTANCE OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS</h1>

<p>Photosynthetic organisms, including plants, algae, and some bacteria, play a key ecological role. They introduce chemical energy and fixed carbon into ecosystems by using light to synthesize sugars.<br/>
    Since these organisms produce their own food that is, fix their own carbon using light energy, they are called photoautotrophs (literally, self-feeders that use light).Humans, and other organisms <br/>
    that can&#8217t convert carbon dioxide to organic compounds themselves, are called heterotrophs, meaning different feeders. Heterotrophs must get fixed carbon by eating other organisms or their by products. <br/>
    Animals, fungi, and many prokaryotes and protists are heterotrophs.<br/>
    Besides introducing fixed carbon and energy into ecosystems, photosynthesis also affects the makeup of Earth&#8217s atmosphere. Most photosynthetic organisms generate oxygen gas as a byproduct, and the advent<br/>
     of photosynthesis over 333 billion years ago, in bacteria resembling modern cyanobacteria forever changed life on Earth. These bacteria gradually released oxygen into Earth&#8217s oxygen poor atmosphere, and <br/>
     the increase in oxygen concentration is thought to have influenced the evolution of aerobic life forms organisms that use oxygen for cellular respiration. If it hadn&#8217t been for those ancient photosynthesizers,<br/>
      we, like many other species, wouldn&#8217t be here today!<br/>
Photosynthetic organisms also remove large quantities of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use the carbon atoms to build organic molecules. Without Earth&#8217s abundance of plants and algae to continually suck up <br/>
carbon dioxide, the gas would build up in the atmosphere. Although photosynthetic organisms remove some of the carbon dioxide produced by human activities, rising atmospheric levels are trapping heat and causing the<br/>
 climate to change. Many scientists believe that preserving forests and other expanses of vegetation is increasingly important to combat this rise in carbon dioxide levels.</p>
